# Modern OpenGL Tutorial and Application for Windows OS #

*Learn Modern OpenGL from scratch and its use in areas such as clinical imaging.*

#### Introduction ####

OpenGL is a graphics library  that can be used to render interactive 2D and 3D graphics applications.
OpenGL has wide range of applications.

#### Modern OpenGL Library Implementation - Part 1  ####

Source code of modern OpenGL library is located under VOGLLib folder . It's a set of header files that can be included by the client applications.

#### Lesson01 - Creating OpenGL Context, Rendering and Mouse/Keyboard input support ####

This post discusses  implementing the basic operations of creating OpenGL context, rendering and mouse/keyboard is discussed. Followed by an lesson that utilizes it.

#### Graphics Pipeline ####

A scene consists of  a set of  3D objects. Transformations such as translation, scaling and rotation as a result of Camera movement, mouse and keyboard input brings them into life.

#### Modern OpenGL Library Implementation - Part 2 ####

Every 3D object such as cube derives from BaseGeometry class. The following describes this in details.

#### Lesson02: Single Colored cube ####

WCF is widely used in managed software for IPC. However porting existing COM based applications to WCF architecture can be daunting task. A balance can be achieved by deploying existing COM based applications as a WCF service so that it can be accessed by WCF clients.

#### Lesson03:Indexed Cube with interpolated colors ####

In Lesson02 we saw that VBO were used to draw the single colored cube. In this post we  will discuss how to draw an Indexed cube using EBO with interpolated colors. It looks as shown above.

#### Lesson04:Textured Cube ####

A Texture is 2D image that can be wrapped around a 3D object like a gift wrapper. For example, resources\textures\bricks2.jpg is a 2D Texture file.

#### Lesson05: Multi-Colored Cube ####

In this post we will try to draw a multi colored cube.

#### Essential 3D math - Vector ####

A 3D vector is represented as [Vx, Vy,  Vz] where  Vx, Vy and Vz represent numbers in 3D cartesian space. Vectors are attributed with a direction represented by its head  and a magnitude computed as square root of the squared sums of its components.

#### Lesson06:Understanding Affine Transformation interactively. ####

In this session we shall understand affine transformations interactively three kinds of affine transformations: Scale, Translate and Rotate on X, Y and  Z axes,
